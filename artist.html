	<h1>ARTIST STATEMENT</h1>

	<!-- 
<p id="p1">As a immigrant and a child of an immigrant, there was a pre-perceived notion of what career paths I should take. I was told to in order to be successful and be the marker of change in my family and pull us out of poverty was to study to become a lawyer, an engineer, a scientist etc.. 
So I did. In the fall of 2016, I attended SJSU as a microbiology major with a minor in chemistry. A semester in, I pulled out most of my hair: eyelashes, eyebrows and head hair included. I could not get myself to understand elemental math let alone understanding the biology behind CRISPER DNA. I wanted to drop out but if I did it would be the death of me. The weight of being an immigrant was this constant worry of becoming someone worthy and making my mother's sacrifices worth it. 
I knew in my gut I could not drop out so I decided two years in to switch my major to something I enjoyed. 
I always found art was an outlet to express myself where words could not. To create something that made myself and others feel certain ways. But most importantly was becoming part of a community where imagination and creativity are precious and praised and not your ability to solve derivatives. Growing up in the Bay Area /East Bay/ Oakland + Hayward. I was drawn to the growing liberating movement in Oakland where people of color were given the chance to present their art to the community and we were given a platform to reach out about issues they cared about. I was inspired by so many people, just to name a few because why not: the power duo Barry Mcgee and the late Margaret Kilgallen, Frida Kahlo, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh, Ryan Matlock, and Jeffery Cheung. 
So here I am trying to figure life out one day at a time while simultaneously worrying about tomorrow. 
Iâ€™m Yolia Espinoza from Michoacan Mexico - a graphic design student at SJSU.
